      <h3>Nigiri Nemesis</h3>
    <p>After Kenji avoids taking damage for 5 seconds, he gains a shield that reduces the next incoming damage by 60%. This defensive boost helps him survive burst attacks and makes him more durable in close combat situations.</p>

    <h2>Hypercharge</h2>
    <h3>All You Can Eat</h3>
      <p>When activated, it enhances his Super ability, Slashimi, by pulling enemies toward the center of his slashing attack. This makes it easier to hit multiple opponents and deal more damage. Additionally, while Hypercharged, Kenji gains increased movement speed and damage output, making him more powerful in battles.</p>
