  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Kenji is a Legendary Brawler in Brawl Stars. He used to be a skilled samurai but left that life behind to open a sushi restaurant after meeting his wife. Sadly, his wife was kidnapped, forcing Kenji to return to his fighting skills. Before each battle, he simply says, "Time to chop and drop," and then moves in without hesitation.
